FacePress
=========

Press your face against the keyboard to determine your hat size!

FacePress is the solution for online hat shopping. Use FacePress when you don't have time to run to the store to try on a hat because you don't know what your hat size is.

Hatsize is determined using a unique algorithm based on the distance between the keys on the keyboard that are pressed down. The most accurate results are calculated when the user rolls his forehead across the keyboard from the end of one eyebrow the end of the other eyebrow. Additional accuracy can be achieved by aiming to roll across the homerow of keys.

Note: This application is still being tested and has only been designed for accuracy on one specific laptop keyboard. External keyboard implementation will yield different and most likely innacurate results.
